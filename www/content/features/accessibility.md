## Your App, Your Rules

GitTop is designed to fit into your workflow, not the other way around. Whether you need high contrast for visibility, specific fonts for readability, or just want to match your system theme, we've got you covered.

## Themes

We support 6 distinct themes out of the box to match every operating system (and gamer aesthetic):

*   **Windows 11:** Matches the native Fluent look of Windows.
*   **macOS:** Clean, flat, and retina-ready.
*   **GTK Dark:** Blends perfectly with Gnome/KDE dark modes.
*   **Light:** A classic, high-brightness theme for well-lit environments.
*   **High Contrast:** Maximizes legibility with pure black/white ratios.
*   **Steam:** Yes, *that* Steam. A dark, moody blue-gray theme for the gamers.

## Legibility controls

Struggling to read small text? You don't need to scale your entire OS.

*   **Notification Text Size:** Slider to scale the main content font from 80% to 150%.
*   **Sidebar Text Size:** Independent scaling for navigation elements.
*   **Sidebar Width:** Drag or slide to find the perfect balance between navigation and content.

## Minimalist Mode (Performance)

For users on older hardware or those who simply crave efficiency, GitTop includes a unique **Icon Style** toggle:

*   **SVG (Default):** Crisp, vector-based icons that look great at any scale.
*   **Emoji:** Replaces all UI icons with native system emojis.
    *   **Why?** Performance maximalists that think 10MB is too much.
    *   **Bonus:** It gives the app a fun, retro-terminal feel.
