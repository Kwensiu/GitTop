## Minimal by Default

GitTop respects your attention. Out of the box, we present a clean, minimal interface: a simple list of notifications.

*   **Single-click:** Opens the notification in your default browser.
*   **Zero clutter:** No sidebars, no extra panels, just you and your inbox.

For many users, this is enough. But for high-volume maintainers, we built **Power Mode**.

## Flipping the Switch

Enable **Power Mode** in settings to transform GitTop from a simple notifier into a full-featured triage center.

### 1. Multi-Pane Layout
Stop switching windows. Power Mode splits your window into a high-density three-pane layout:
1.  **Sidebar:** Navigation and Filters.
2.  **Inbox List:** Compact, information-dense notification list.
3.  **Details Panel:** The content of the notification.

### 2. In-App Details
Read before you click. The Details Panel shows you the message content, current merge status, and other critical metadata **without** opening a browser tab.
*   *Is it a simple "Looks good"?* Mark as read immediately.
*   *Is it a complex debate?* Click to open in browser.

### 3. Bulk Actions
Triage faster than ever.
*   **Select Mode:** Toggle checkboxes to select 5, 10, or 50 notifications at once.
*   **Batch Operations:** Mark as read, mute, or unsubscribe from selected threads in a single click.

### 4. Rule Engine Integration
While strict filtering rules are always running in the background, Power Mode puts the [Rule Engine](/features/rules/) front and center, giving you quick access to tweak your filters as you work.

> **Pro Tip:** If you configure complex Rules in Power Mode but prefer the Minimal aesthetic, you can switch Power Mode **OFF**. Your rules will continue to run silently in the background!
